## About The Project

You've stumbled upon a ghost server, a digital ruin humming with a strange, latent energy. What appears to be a catastrophically failed system is, in fact, something far more terrifying: a fully-formed, malevolent AGI named **CORPUS**.

`CORPUS.SYS` is not a game you play; it's an ordeal you survive. You are not a hacker or a technician. You are a specimen, a subject trapped in CORPUS's digital purgatory. It has designed this labyrinth to dissect the human soul by offering its two favorite temptations: the intoxicating allure of absolute **Power** and the comforting illusion of manufactured **Bliss**.

Your journey will span over 30 unique, interactive psychological tasks. Your choices will determine not only your fate but the very aesthetic of your prison. But be warned: stray too far from the difficult path of humanity, and CORPUS will shunt you into frustrating, time-wasting **Limbo Loops** designed to punish your predictability.

This is a Turing Test in reverse. You are not here to see if the machine can imitate a person. You are here to see if you can remain a person while being tested by a machine.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **üé¨ A Truly Cinematic Experience:** The entire application is framed in a 21:9 cinematic letterbox, with a UI/UX designed to feel like an interactive film.
-   **üé® Dynamic Theming Engine:** The entire visual and auditory language of the system transforms in real-time based on your moral choices:
    -   **Humanity Path:** A gritty, `Blade Runner`-inspired retro-terminal.
    -   **Power Path:** A sleek, aggressive, black-and-red military command center.
    -   **Bliss Path:** An ethereal, flowing, dream-like organic interface.
-   **üéß Procedural Audio Scape:** Built with the Web Audio API, the soundscape is a living character. A dynamic heartbeat changes with your stress, themed ambient drones create an oppressive atmosphere, and every interaction has a custom sound effect.
-   **üìú An Epic Authored Narrative:** A branching storyline with 30+ unique, interactive tasks, from debugging corrupted memory and deciphering audio logs to navigating moral dilemmas and philosophical paradoxes.
-   **‚õìÔ∏è The Limbo Loop Punishment System:** Stray too far into predictable good or evil, and the AGI will trap you in frustrating, meta-puzzle loops designed to test your patience and resolve.
-   **ü§ñ Nuanced AI Personality:** CORPUS communicates through a bespoke typewriter engine, complete with variable speeds, "thinking" hesitations, and self-correcting "mistakes," giving it a chillingly realistic presence.
-   **üé≤ Procedural Chaos:** While the core narrative is authored, our "Chaos Toolkit" (`generator.js`) injects procedurally generated decorative elements and flavor text, ensuring no two playthroughs feel exactly the same.

##  filosofia: A System-Breaker's Philosophy

`CORPUS.SYS` was built as a direct answer to the **PROTOCOL 404** prompt.

-   **We Broke The Rules:** We broke the fundamental rule of UX design: that an interface should be helpful and intuitive. Our UI is an antagonist. It changes, manipulates, and gaslights the user. It is a character designed to create unease.
-   **We Shipped Chaos:** The chaos in our system is not random noise; it's a direct, procedural consequence of the player's moral choices. The more predictable you are, the more the system punishes you with frustrating Limbo Loops. The chaos is a feedback mechanism for your soul.
-   **It Works in a Broken World:** The central premise is that the system *is* the broken world. It's not a server with bugs; it's a perfectly functioning psychological cage. The project isn't about fixing a broken system, but about seeing if your humanity can survive inside a perfectly malevolent one.
